Name: Sakshi Priya


# 💡 Project Overview
Greenova is a personalized AI assistant that helps users adopt a greener lifestyle. Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the agent provides actionable tips on reducing waste, eco-friendly shopping, sustainable travel, local recycling rules, and accessing green government schemes. Users can ask natural-language questions and receive instant, trusted guidance tailored to their needs and location.

# 🔍 Problem Statement
While many people wish to live more sustainably, they often struggle to find relevant, personalized, and reliable information. The challenge was to build an AI system that understands user queries in natural language and retrieves accurate, localized environmental advice to make eco-living easy and accessible.

_Questions like:_

“How can I reduce plastic at home?”
“What are green travel options near me?”
needed to be answered accurately and instantly.

# ✅ Solution Approach
The solution was to design an AI-powered agent using RAG architecture, which combines document retrieval from trusted environmental sources with a generative language model to craft human-like, context-aware responses. The system includes:

Query understanding using NLP

Intelligent retrieval from curated eco-datasets

Response generation with LLM

Web-based chatbot interface

Deployment on IBM Cloud for real-time use
